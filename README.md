Some templates I've created for DIY eurorack panels

## BitBox
A black panel for the 1010Music BitBox (mk1 version, though it might also work on the mk2, I just don't have one to test with). Provided in FrontPanelExpress file format. Currently labeled "blackbox" because I thought that would be a funny name, and I chose it before they introduced their stand-alone Blackbox sampler. Feel free to modify it as you wish. This version is set for engraved text, but you can change to have the text printed to save a little on cost.

## Tonestar8106
A custom black panel for the Studio Electronics Tonestar 8106. This hole layout should also work for the Tonestar 2600, but you'll want to replace the graphics of course.
